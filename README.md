Firmware in Atmega328PB (Atmega328P)

I created the firmware using a MCS-Basom-AVR editor/compiler version 2.0.8.1 (some kind of a Basic-like language). I can't guarantee that it is error free. It runs on the 8 MHz frequency of internal RC oscillator. So, when programming, it is necessary to turn off the frequency division of eight in the configuration bits. I also recommend setting Brown-Out to 2.7 Volts (reset when supply voltage drops). I saved compiled hex and bin code for both Atmega types into the DOWNLOAD section of this web-page. I plan to save the source code there, but later, after I comment it in a comprehensible way.
